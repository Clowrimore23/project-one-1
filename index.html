    <h1>Study Guide!</h1>
    <p>this study guide is to show you what all the html codes are and what they do!</p>
     <p>first, these are the most important part of the code. the 'bracket' it goes around all the code, and is needed for you to actually code!</p> &lt; &gt;
    <section class="headers">
        <h3>  Headers, Titles</h3>
        <p> Let's start with header tags, (h1-h6)</p>
            <h1> &lt; h1> header! < /h1 &gt; </h1>
              <h2>&lt; h2> header! < /h2 &gt;</h2>
             <h3>&lt; h3> header! < /h3 &gt;</h3>
            <h4>&lt; h4> header! < /h4 &gt;</h4>
           <h5>&lt; h5> header! < /h5 &gt;</h5>
           <h6>&lt; h6> header! < /h6 &gt;</h6>
   
    <p>These headers are important, they allow us to head our pages, and when we search them in a search engine, the browser looks for the h1 in the code for keywords that you search!</p>
    <p>Titles can be just as important, they tell the page the title, if you look at the text in the tab youre in, it tells you the title!</p>

<section class="paragraph">
    <h3>Paragraph</h3>
<p class="p">This class is salmost just as important as the header tag! this allows you to begin paragraphs and organize your text! you can give these tags a class (we'll talk about that in a second!) to organize them more and even style them!</p>
<p class="ex">&lt; p> this is how you begin every part of your code that does't have some kind of tag that is specific for it, like images or headers! < /p  &gt; </p>
</section> 
<section class="lists">
    <h3>Lists</h3>
<p>now we're moving onto the lists! They can be kind of tricky, but they're so helpful! </p>

      <h4>An un-ordered List!</h4>

    &lt;ul&gt;<ul> 
            &lt;li> <li>Coffee</li><
             /li &gt;
   </ul>  &lt;/ul&gt; 
<p>this list as you can see, there are no numbers by the objects, but the one below is for numbered lists.</p>
        <h4>An ordered List!</h4>

        &lt;ol&gt;<ol> 
                &lt;li> <li>Coffee</li><
                 /li &gt;
                 
       </ol>  &lt;/ol&gt; 
</section>
<section class="anchor">
    <h3>Anchors and Links</h3>
    <p>Now for anchors! Not the cool ones tht ships use but the cool link ones! anchors are used to link things in your page. You know, those blue underlined things on a page? That's the one! It can be internal links and external links that take you to new websites! </p>
    
    &lt;a href= "link"&gt; <a href="link"> </a> &lt;/a&gt;

</section>
<section class="image">
    <p>Images are one of the best things to put in a website. They can be used for pictures, obviously, but also logos! A lot of the time it's external links to the image, so if the original poster takes down the image you use, you can't use it anymore!</p>
    &lt;img src="cat" alt="cat"&gt; <img src="https://kittentoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cool-cat-in-glasses.jpg" alt="cat">
</section>
<section class="hTml">
    <p>html is the most important of them all besides the <>, It tells the website what kind of document its supposed to be. </p>
    &lt;html&gt; &lt;p&gt; blah blah &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/html&gt; 
</section>
<section class="head">
    <h3>Head and Body</h3>
    <p>Head refers to the head of the document. In the head you place important things, like you would a real head. In the head you can place links to external text and your css page!</p>
    <p>below the head you have the body, just like normal people, they have a head above the body! the body is where you put all the other important things, that lets the documetn know what it's supposed to contain and show!</p>
</section>
<section class="spans">
    <h3>Spans, Divs, Sections</h3>
    <p>All three of these have one thing in common. They wrap around things you are working on to make it more organized and more easy to read. They help with selecting things in your css so that you can style them more and style them seperately!</p>
    &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</section>
<section class="headers">
    <h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
    <p>Bet you can guess where these go! yup! the head and the foot of the document! they allow you to place things in them. They are very much like the head tags but, they are like the very first and last things that span across the entire document!</p>
    &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
</section>
<section class="navs">
    <h3>Last three! Main, Nav, and Aside!</h3>
    <p> The main is the main content of a document. It is only for specific things that are unique to the document!</p>
    <p>The nav is for......navigation!! It helps you navigate the page, or to other places. It helps you find you way around.</p>
    <p>Last but not least we have the aside. It's kind of like a main, except it seems to be really useful for sidebars!</p>
    &lt;main&gt; &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt; &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
